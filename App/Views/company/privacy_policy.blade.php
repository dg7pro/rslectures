        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-2">COOKIES  </h4>
        <p class="mb-2">To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use "cookies", or
            similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique,
            random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual
            interests using the Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself
            (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are,
            even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie
            can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our
            Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers
            may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads),
            a process that we do not control.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's
            connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site.
            (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where
            to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify
            you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request,
            to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site
            and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">Such information will not be considered as sensitive if it is freely available and
            accessible in the public domain or is furnished under the Right to Information Act,
            2005 or any other law for the time being in force.</p>


        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-2">INFORMATION SHARING  </h4>
        <p class="mb-2">We shares the sensitive personal information to any third party without obtaining the

        <p class="mb-2">(a) When it is requested or required by law or by any court or governmental agency
            or authority to disclose, for the purpose of verification of identity, or for the prevention,
            detection, investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution and punishment
            of offences. These disclosures are made in good faith and belief that such disclosure
            is reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms; for complying with the applicable
            laws and regulations.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">(b) We proposes to share such information within its group companies and officers and

            such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy
            and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-2">INFORMATION SECURITY </h4>
        <p class="mb-2">We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or
            unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal
            reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures,
            including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against
            unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our controlled database.
            The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is
            password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security
            measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security
            of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted
            while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you
            include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
            However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from
            time to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information
            we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected,
            regardless of what the new policy may be.</p>
